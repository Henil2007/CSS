        </li>
        <p class="history">C is a general-purpose programming language created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie. By design, C gives the programmer relatively direct access to the features of the typical CPU architecture, customized for the target instruction set. It has been and continues to be used to implement operating system, device drivers, and protocol stacks, but its use in application software has been decreasing. C is used on computers that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems.</p>

            <h2>Data Types</h2>
            <div class="data">in C refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted. In this chapter, we will learn about data types in C.</div>

                <th class="type">Int</th>
                <th class="info">An integer data type is a fundamental data type in computer programming that represents whole numbers—positive, negative, or zero—without any fractional or decimal parts. Typically stored as 4 bytes (32 bits), standard integers range from \(-2,147,483,648\) to \(2,147,483,647\), allowing efficient calculations for counting and indexing. </th>

                <th class="type">Float</th>
                <th class="info">A float (floating-point) data type is a fundamental programming data type used to represent fractional numbers, decimals, and real numbers requiring high precision, such as \(3.14\) or \(-0.01\). It typically occupies 32 bits (4 bytes) of memory, storing numbers with roughly 7 decimal digits of precision and a range of approximately</th>

                <th class="type">Double</th>
                <th class="info">The double data type is a 64-bit (8-byte) IEEE 754 floating-point format used to store high-precision decimal numbers, offering 15-17 significant decimal digits. It provides a much larger range—approximately compared to the 32-bit float type. It is commonly used for complex, scientific, or financial calculations needing high accuracy, though it is slower than float.</th>

                <th class="type">Char</th>
                <th class="info">The char keyword is a data type that is used to store a single character. A char value must be surrounded by single quotes, like 'A' or 'c'. The signed and unsigned keywords treat the char as an integer type. A signed char can represent values between -128 and 127.</th>

                <th class="info">An array is a linear data structure that stores a collection of similar data elements (e.g., all integers or all characters) in contiguous memory locations. It is used to organize data for efficient access using a numerical index, which typically starts at 0 for the first element. </th>

                <th class="type">Pointer</th>
                <th class="info">A pointer is a variable in programming that stores the memory address of another variable rather than a direct value. Used heavily in C/C++ for low-level memory manipulation, they enable efficient array handling, dynamic memory allocation, and passing large structures to functions. Pointers are declared using * (e.g., int *p) and assigned using &.</th>

                <th class="info">A function in C is a self-contained, reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions help break large, complex programs into smaller, more manageable parts, improving code organization, readability, and modularity. Every C program must have at least one function, main(), which is the entry point for execution. </th>
